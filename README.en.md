## 📖 Introduction

Self Music is a music management and playback system for individuals and small teams. It provides an elegant UI and a smooth playback experience, supports playlist management, lyrics synchronization, artist/album data browsing, and has a built-in admin backend (JWT authentication), ready to use out of the box.

## 🚀 One-Click Deploy

We offer three convenient deployment methods: `Docker Run`, `Docker Compose`, and [Pagoda Panel Deployment](#-quick-start).

### Method 1: Using Docker Run (Recommended)

This is the easiest and fastest way to get started. You can run the entire application with just one command.

**Recommended for servers in China (using accelerated mirror):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name self-music-app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 6230:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/music_data":/data \
  docker.cnb.cool/onmicrosoft/self-music:latest
```

**For overseas servers or local development (using official Docker Hub image):**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name self-music-app \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 6230:80 \
  -v "$(pwd)/music_data":/data \
  zkeq/self-music:latest
```
- After starting, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:6230`.
- All data (database, configuration files, music files) will be saved in the `music_data` folder in the current directory (restart the project after changing the password to update it automatically).
- Default administrator account: `admin` / `admin123`.

### Method 2: Using Docker Compose

If you need more flexible configuration or want to do secondary development, you can use `docker-compose`.

1.  **Clone this project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zkeq/Self-music.git
    cd Self-music
    ```

2.  **Start the service**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
- After starting, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🔧 Local Development

If you need to do secondary development, please set up your local environment as follows.

1.  **Prerequisites**
    - Python 3.8+
    - Node.js 18+
    - pnpm (recommended)

2.  **Clone the project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zkeq/Self-music.git
    cd Self-music
    ```

3.  **Start the backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    - The backend service runs at `http://localhost:8000`

4.  **Start the frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
    - The frontend service runs at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ☁️ Cloud Server Deployment (Backend) [Using Pagoda Panel]

1. Upload the `backend` folder to the `/root` directory on your server.
   <img width="2005" height="776" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4da357c8-ba77-4bfb-bc1f-fecd4f122349" />

2. Change the `jwt secret` to a random string in `main.py`.
   ![image-20250817131014518](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250817131014618.png)

3. Change the default admin account and password in `main.py`.
   ![image-20250817131115205](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250817131115307.png)

4. Open Pagoda Panel -> Websites -> `Python Project` -> `Add Site`.
   Create a new virtual environment.
   ![image-20250731101721616](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250731101721697.png)

5. Fill out the form as shown below.
   ![image-20250731101757603](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250731101757694.png)

6. After clicking confirm, the project will create the virtual environment and install dependencies. Wait for the installation to complete.

7. Click on settings to view the project log.
   ![image-20250731101900749](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250731101900862.png)

8. If you get an error that a dependency is not found, click on `Terminal` in the `Actions` column and manually enter `pip install xxx (package name)`. If it says the port is occupied, change to an unused port in `main.py`.
   ![image-20250731102037862](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250731102037989.png)

9.  Request the service port to check the running status. (If you see this string, the service is running normally).
    ![image-20250731102123918](https://img.onmicrosoft.cn/zkeq/20250731102123995.png)

10. The backend deployment is complete. You can now set up a reverse proxy with a domain on your CDN to go live.
